# hello_django
MVP for django web server running on a local machine


This file is optimized for a publishing in Hello_Django>Django_site>settings.py
with the following line of code:
    # SECURITY WARNING: keep the secret key used in production secret!
    SECRET_KEY = env('SECRET_KEY')

To make this work, you'll have to create a file in the root of the Hello_Django directory.
